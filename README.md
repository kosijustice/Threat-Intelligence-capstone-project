KORTNIT GROUP-OSINT Driven Threat Intelligence Assessment.

## Project Summary
This project delivers an OSINT-driven cyber threat intelligence assessment on The Home Depot (homedepot.com), the world’s largest home improvement retailer. Using reconnaissance tools and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the assessment identifies digital exposures, evaluates active ransomware groups targeting the retail sector, and provides risk-based recommendations.

2. Discovered:
2000+ domain hosts
10+ exposed IP addresses
Publicly available employee emails & personal data
3. Profiled two active ransomware groups relevant to retail:
a. Scattered Spider (UNC3944) – High-risk, retail-focused group exploiting MFA fatigue & helpdesk impersonation.
b. ALPHV/BlackCat – Ransomware-as-a-Service group known for large-scale retail and e-commerce extortion.
